# Report-Generator

This was one of my first coding projects, and it consists of a Python program that creates marketing reports. The program will take one of two inputs, either a Word or an Excel file, and it will create a report with all the entries. Some problems that the program had to solve were:
- Ability to detect the information on the Word file using Python. Text processing and detection of keywords.
- Web scrapping to obtain screenshots of newspapers and social media.
- Interface using Gmail to allow a non-technical person to use the program.
